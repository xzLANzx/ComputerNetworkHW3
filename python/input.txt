School is another example of where bulk texting can be effective. Schools can divide their database of contacts into groups of students, parents, teachers, and administrators so that each group can be informed instantly and simultaneously of important school events. Again, bulk text messaging can be of vital importance in times of emergency to keep students safe and parents informed. Possibly the most significant non-commercial bulk text message occurred in 2008, when President Obama announced Joe Biden as his running mate. Approximately three million Americans opted-in to the President´s bulk text messaging service to hear the news first. Those three million contacts subsequently generated record-breaking political donations that contributed to the President´s re-election in 2012. President Obama may have been the first to solicit donations by bulk text, but he wasn´t the last. Many charitable organizations, churches and community projects now use bulk texting as a way of raising funds. Political parties continue to raise funds using “text-to-donate” campaigns, as well as taking advantage of a bulk text messaging service to “Get Out the Vote” on Election Day.
